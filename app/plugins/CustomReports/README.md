# Matomo CustomReports Plugin

## Description

Hi, this is David from [InnoCraft](https://www.innocraft.com), the company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used 
by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.

At InnoCraft, we know that all businesses and organizations have different goals and needs. It is therefore important to
get the insights you need in order to achieve your goals and improve your websites and apps. While Matomo comes with a great set of standard reports, you can often not get all the information you need. 

> In the past, this meant you could either not get the information you wanted, or you had to create the report manually in a spreadsheet which takes hours and is error-prone.

This is where Custom Reports rocks. It takes this cumbersome work away by allowing you to create a new report in only seconds. You can choose from over 200 different dimensions and metrics to get the insights
 you need. You can further customize the report by choosing between different
 visualizations, and even define report filters (view a report only for a subset of your visitors, like a segment). 

Wondering what some examples could be? For example, you could drill down any dimension by hour or even minute. Wondering at which minute of the day your pages are generated the slowest? You are only a few clicks away from finding it out. Because you can select multiple dimensions, you can also build new reports over three levels such as "Events Category, Event Name, and Event Action" where Matomo only supports two levels. You can also get lots of valuable information by drilling down reports by user (for example see which Page URLs each user has viewed), by country, by device type, and much more. 

> Custom Reports supports even some dimensions and metrics that are not available in Matomo yet! And if you are missing some dimensions or metrics, we are likely able to add them for you.
