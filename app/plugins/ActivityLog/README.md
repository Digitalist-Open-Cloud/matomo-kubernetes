# Matomo ActivityLog Plugin

## Description

Are you having other users on your Matomo and care as much about security as we do? Ever had the problem that you were asked what happened to a website and you couldn't answer it? Does your customer or co-worker claim they have changed nothing but something was deleted? Wonder who created a specific goal or website? Being a little scared about giving a new user access to all your data? Want to see when someone is trying to log in to your Matomo? Or maybe your company is required to keep an audit trail? We hear you.

With Activity Log, also known as audit log or audit trail, you keep an eye on everything that is happening in your Matomo Analytics. It lets you easily identify problems, improves security, and risk management.
