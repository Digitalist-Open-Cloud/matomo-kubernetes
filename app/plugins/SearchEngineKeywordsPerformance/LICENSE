InnoCraft License

This InnoCraft End User License Agreement (the "InnoCraft EULA") is between you and InnoCraft Ltd (NZBN 6106769) ("InnoCraft"). If you are agreeing to this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then "Customer" or "you" means your company, and you are binding your company to this Agreement. InnoCraft may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject to the terms in Section (xii) below.

By clicking on the "I’ve read and accept the terms & conditions (https://shop.matomo.org/terms-conditions/)" (or similar button) that is presented to you at the time of your Order, or by using or accessing InnoCraft products, you indicate your assent to be bound by this Agreement.


InnoCraft EULA

(i) InnoCraft is the licensor of the Plugin for Matomo Analytics (the "Software").

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, InnoCraft grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software only on hardware systems owned, leased or controlled by you, during the applicable License Term. The term of each Software license ("License Term") will be specified in your Order. Your License Term will end upon any breach of this Agreement.

(iii) Unless otherwise specified in your Order, for each Software license that you purchase, you may install one production instance of the Software in a Matomo Analytics instance owned or operated by you, and accessible via one URL ("Matomo instance"). Additional licenses must be purchased in order to deploy the Software in multiple Matomo instances, including when these multiple Matomo instances are hosted on a single hardware system.

(iv) Licenses granted by InnoCraft are granted subject to the condition that you must ensure the maximum number of Authorized Users that are able to access and use the Software is equal to the number of User Licenses for which the necessary fees have been paid to InnoCraft for the Subscription period. You may upgrade your license at any time on payment of the appropriate fees to InnoCraft in order to increase the maximum number of authorized users. “User License” means a license granted under this EULA to you to permit an Authorized User to use the Software. The number of User Licenses granted to you is dependent on the fees paid by you. “Authorized User” means a person who has an account in the Matomo instance and for which the necessary fees (“Subscription fees”) have been paid to InnoCraft for the current license term.

(v) Piwik Analytics was renamed to Matomo Analytics in January 2018. The same terms and conditions as well as any restrictions or grants apply if you are using any version of Piwik.

(vi) The Software requires a license key in order to operate, which will be delivered to the email addresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the applicable fees.

(vii) Any information that InnoCraft may collect from you or your device will be subject to InnoCraft Privacy Policy (https://www.innocraft.com/privacy).

(viii) You are bound by the Matomo Marketplace Terms and Conditions (https://shop.matomo.org/terms-conditions/).

(ix) You may not reverse engineer or disassemble or re-distribute the Software in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the Software, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by InnoCraft.

(x) The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. InnoCraft own all title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software, and the Software is licensed to you directly by InnoCraft, not sold.

(xi) The Software is provided under an "as is" basis and without any support or maintenance. Nothing in this Agreement shall require InnoCraft to provide you with support or fixes to any bug, failure, mis-performance or other defect in The Software. InnoCraft may provide you, from time to time, according to his sole discretion, with updates of the Software. You hereby warrant to keep the Software up-to-date and install all relevant updates. InnoCraft shall provide any update free of charge.

(xii) The Software is provided "as is", and InnoCraft hereby disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to any implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. InnoCraft shall not be liable or responsible in any way for any losses or damage of any kind, including lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages, relating to your use of or reliance upon the Software.

(xiii) We may update or modify this Agreement from time to time, including the referenced Privacy Policy and the Matomo Marketplace Terms and Conditions. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact you designate in the applicable Order). If we modify the Agreement during your License Term or Subscription Term, the modified version will be effective upon your next renewal of a License Term.
