# Search Engine Keywords Performance Plugin for Matomo

## Description

*Hi, this is Stefan from [InnoCraft](https://www.innocraft.com). The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.* 

*Some years ago most search engines decided to hide keywords from the referrer urls, which made it impossible for web analytics tools to report reliable keyword statistics. Tools like Matomo started reporting keyword searches as "Keyword not defined" or "Keyword not provided".* 

> Ever wondered how to get better insights on those hidden keywords?

*With our Search Engine Keywords Performance plugin, you will get back deep insights about all the keywords that people are searching for when clicking on your websites. All of your keywords directly into your familiar Matomo Analytics reports. The biggest search engines are providing tools and APIs that allow us, website owners, to get the list of our keywords along with the critical metrics Impressions, Clicks, ClickThrough ratio and Average position in the Search results page. This plugin makes it easy for you to connect to the APIs and will automatically import your valuable keyword data into Matomo Referrers reports.*

> Stop being in the dark about this incredible keyword searches information and know what your users and customers are searching for.

*Which queries caused your website to appear in search results? Stop wasting time by looking up keyword statistics in serveral Webmaster Tools and start getting combined results across all supported search engines within Matomo. Which queries result in more traffic to your website than others? Improve your SEO efforts and monitor your position and performance for each Keyword directly in your Matomo reports.*

> As a bonus you will also get a new "Crawling overview" report which reports all the most important information about how Search Engines robots crawl your websites. 

*Was there any server errors or connection timeout? How many pages of my websites were crawled and indexed? How many page not found errors? How many total inbound links were found pointing to my website? Keep an eye on these search crawling metrics metrics directly within Matomo. Do not miss important errors and maximise your SEO power to get more traffic!* 

> Eliminate "not found" pages that give your visitors a bad experience and lose less visitors on your website

*Have you ever been stuck on a so called "404 not found" page? What are the chances that you continue browsing on this website or the chance that you find the page you were looking for afterwards? The page crawling errors reports gives you a list of all pages that could not be crawled by a search engine with a detailed reason. This helps you to take the right actions to improve the experience on your website. For the Google search engine you will also be able to see all inbound links for such pages. Use this information to easily update links to your pages which are incorrect.*

### How Search Keywords Performance monitor works

Google and other bigger search engines provide webmaster tools that allow website owners to access various statistics about their websites.

In Matomo you will be guided to set up access to these APIs - it just takes a few minutes. Matomo will then automatically start importing your keyword statistics every day.

In most webmaster tools you will even get some access to your historical keyword data. For example Google lets you view keyword statistics for the past three months. And when you use Search Engine Keywords Performance, the beauty is that you will keep a full copy of your valuable keyword data within Matomo and this data will be stored there forever. So you will be able to view the evolution of your keywords metrics and KPIs over many months and years and over time compare how your search analytics keywords evolve. Monitoring SEO has never been so easy! Matomo lets you once again keep full control of your data and gain more insights.
