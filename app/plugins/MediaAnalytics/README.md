# Media Analytics for Matomo

## Description

Hi, this is Tom from [InnoCraft](https://www.innocraft.com). The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.

Over the past years we have spent a fortune and lots of our time on producing video and audio content for our websites 
and apps. But are they being watched? For how long? By whom? From where are they watching it? How do they affect our 
conversion rates and sales? Is it better when we place that video somewhere else or replace it with another one? 
Would another video perform better? When we added subtitles, did it change something? How are our video marketing campaigns doing? Can we justify the cost and time for producing them? If you have similar questions and unknowns, then we have built just the right tool for you.

> [Media Analytics](https://www.media-analytics.net) tracks your videos and audio and gives you ultimate insights into media usage and how that usage is connected to all your other metrics like conversions, sales, page views and more. 

We have put a lot of love in building Media Analytics and added so many advanced features it has really given us another view on our media content and we are sure it can do the same for you when you have it.

Media Analytics is super simple to install and works in most cases just like that out of the box. 
It is so well integrated into Matomo you will be surprised. It has all of those features like getting real time 
insights, filtering reports to a particular user segment, the audience log shows you every step your audience 
did and the audience map shows you from where your media is being watched either in real time or in the past.
On top there are so many other reports, widgets, APIs and more giving you all the information you need to know and you can 
share all of them with your colleagues and customers.

> If you are spending money or time on your media like we do, we are sure it will give you plenty of insights and maybe change the way you think about your current media.
