Notes from Piwik developers
---
This library has been added to port some functions that appeared after the
php 5.1 release.

We removed most of the function definitions to only leave the ones that are
used in Piwik.

Find the full library on http://upgradephp.berlios.de/
---
Additional functions provided to emulate built-in functions that are
disabled or unsafe.
